        <h2 class="mb-3">Crafting Superior Prompts</h2>
        <p>The quality of the prompts you input determines the quality of the responses you receive. To leverage the full potential of MachineSpiritClaude, follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Be Clear and Concise: Make your question or request as clear as possible. Steer clear of complex language or ambiguities that might confuse the AI.</li>
            <li>Provide Context: Some background information can guide the AI to generate more accurate and relevant responses.</li>
            <li>Ask Specific Questions: The more precise you are with your question, the more precise the AI will be with its answer. Avoid broad or open-ended questions when possible.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="mb-3">Generating Imagery Prompts</h2>
        <p>MachineSpiritClaude is also equipped to assist with generating imagery prompts. To maximize this feature, consider these tips:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Describe the Scene: Clearly portray the scene or subject you want the AI to illustrate. Be as detailed as possible about important elements or features.</li>
            <li>Specify the Style: If you have a particular style in mind, include it in your request (e.g., "Generate a vintage-style poster of a beach scene").</li>
            <li>Convey Emotions or Mood: Adding emotions or mood can infuse your image with life (e.g., "Generate an image of a joyous family at a sunny park picnic").</li>
        </ol>

         <h2 class="mb-3"> Modes </h2>
        <p> Utilize the different "mode" options to tune the responses you get from the AI. "Expert" mode will give you more authoritative answers, while "Creative" mode will allow for more chaos/variability in the response you receive. Some queries don't have much room for interpretation, and will return similar results regardless of the chosen "mode". Selecting no particular mode leaves you right in the middle.</p>
